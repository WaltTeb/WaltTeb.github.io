          Originally created as a hackathon project during <a href='https://hackumass.com/'>HackUMass XI</a> in October of 2023, 
          BreathlyEZ is a wifi enabled breathalyzer. A last minute creation with my friend <a href='https://github.com/Sinjiner'>Ashton P</a>, 
          the original version of BreathlyEZ was created in 14 hours.

          The BreathlyEZ consists of 4 main components: the MQ3 alcohol gas sensor, an Arduino UNO, a Raspberry Pi, and a React.js website.
          <ol>
          <li>The MQ3 alcohol gas sensor is able to detect the PPM of alcohol in a sample of air blown over it's ceramic heated resistor.</li>
          <li>The Arduino UNO was used exclusively for analog to digital conversion (ADC), sending that value to the Raspberry Pi via serial port.</li>
          <li>The Raspberry Pi performed the necessary calculations to convert PPM to blood alcohol content (BAC), this was value could then be obtained
          by querying the web server being hosted on the Raspberry Pi.</li>
          <li>Finally the React.js website displays the latest sample BAC, as well as a button to trigger a new sample collection.</li>
          </ol>
