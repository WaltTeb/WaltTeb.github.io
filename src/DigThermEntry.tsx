                The thermometer consisted of 3 main components: the temperature sensor, the 7-segment LED display, and the Arduino UNO.

                    <li>
                        The temperature sensor gave varying milivolt values depending on ambient temperature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The 7-segment display was used to display the calculated temperature reading. Persistance of vision allowed 
                        the display to appear to show all 4 sections active.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ATmega328P microntroller on the Arduino UNO collected analog voltage values from the temperature sensor,
                        and used a characteristic equation to obtain a temperature. The microntroller would then turn off and on the correct
                        display segments in order to display the current temperature. Additonally a button could be pressed to toggle the 
                        thermometer between fahrenheit and celcuis.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    The hardest part of the project was getting the 7-segment display to properly show each digital value.
                    This involved testing each of the 12 pins on the display to figure out which segment/digit on the display it controlled by each pin.
                    This information was used to turn on each digit for 5 miliseconds to display each number sequentially. Quickly switching between
                    each digit, keeping it illuminated for only 5 miliseconds will appear as if all 4 digits are on at the same time, leveraging <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision'>persistance of vision</a>.
